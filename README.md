# Collaborative Realtime Text Editor

This project is a collaborative realtime text editor where multiple users can join and work together in real time. Itâ€™s designed to test and demonstrate the capabilities of API Gateway with WebSocket support for real-time communication. Built with a modern stack, this project aims to showcase scalable, cloud-native collaboration features, including the deployment simplicity offered by AWS SAM.

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Test and explore the ability of AWS API Gateway to support WebSocket communication for real-time applications.
**Features**:
- Realtime text editing with multiple users
- Collaborative editing, where changes are instantly reflected across users
- WebSocket-based communication for seamless real-time updates

**Tech Stack**
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Hosting and Deployment: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB), deployed via AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)

**Project Architecture**
- React Frontend: Handles the user interface, with hooks and WebSocket connections for real-time updates.
- Node.js Backend: Manages WebSocket connections, handles user sessions, and processes collaborative events.
- AWS API Gateway: Manages WebSocket connections to support real-time updates and collaboration.
- AWS SAM: Simplifies deployment and resource management, packaging Lambda functions, API Gateway configurations, and other AWS resources.

**Key Components**
- WebSocket Communication: Enables live, bi-directional communication for real-time collaboration.
- State Management: Maintains the current document state across multiple users.
- Data Storage: DynamoDB (or another persistent data layer) to store document history and user sessions.
- Deployment Automation: AWS SAM to automate resource creation and deployment.
